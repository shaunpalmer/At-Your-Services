1. **Customer Class**: Handles customer-specific attributes and behaviors, such as personal details and associated jobs.
2. **Company Class**: Manages business-specific data, including company details and associated individuals.
3. **Team Member Class**: Tracks staff information and their roles in completed jobs.

#### Methods and Responsibilities

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete for each entity.

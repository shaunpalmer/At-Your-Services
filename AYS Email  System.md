To set up an email system for your At Your Service plugin, we‚Äôll want to ensure it‚Äôs robust and flexible, supporting various types of emails like confirmations, reminders, and notifications. Here‚Äôs an outline of the key components and considerations:

Email Sending Method:

PHP‚Äôs wp_mail() function: This is the native WordPress email function and can be a quick start. However, it depends on your hosting server, which may not always be reliable.
SMTP Integration: To improve deliverability, consider connecting to an SMTP service (e.g., Gmail SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun). This can be configured within WordPress or through an SMTP plugin, or you can set it up directly within your plugin‚Äôs settings.
External APIs: If you need more advanced options, integrating with email services like SendGrid or Mailchimp via their API could give you better control and tracking.
Template System:

Customizable Templates: Create HTML templates for each type of email. These could be stored as files in your plugin folder or within the WordPress database, depending on how flexible you want it to be for users.
Template Tags: Define placeholders in the templates (like {{customer_name}} or {{service_name}}) that get replaced with dynamic data when the email is sent.
Styling: CSS for emails can be tricky, so inline styles or pre-designed templates optimized for email clients are often used.
Email Types and Triggers:

Event-Based Emails: You‚Äôll want emails triggered by events like new bookings, service reminders, and status updates. Hook into actions within your plugin, e.g., new_lead_created, appointment_reminder, or job_completed.
Scheduled Emails: For reminders or follow-ups, use WordPress‚Äôs wp_cron to schedule emails at specific intervals.
Conditional Logic: Allow conditional sending, like only sending a follow-up if a customer hasn‚Äôt booked in a set period.
Settings Page for Customization:

Admin Interface: Allow plugin users to adjust email settings, including the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù address, SMTP details (if applicable), and toggle specific emails on or off.
Content Customization: Include fields for subject lines, customizable headers, footers, and other content to give users control over the look and feel of their emails.
Logging and Error Handling:

Email Logs: Store logs of sent emails for debugging and tracking purposes. This can be a simple database table that records email content, status, and timestamps.
Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling to alert users if an email fails, especially if using an external SMTP or API.
Testing and Deliverability:

Testing Tools: Tools like Mailtrap or even WordPress‚Äôs wp_mail() testing plugins can be useful to ensure emails are correctly formatted.
SPF/DKIM Records: If using a custom domain, check that your SPF and DKIM records are correctly set up to improve deliverability.
üë∏üèª: Would you like to start with a simple wp_mail() setup as a base, or do you want to explore SMTP or API-based options for better control and reliability?

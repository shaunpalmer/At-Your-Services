WordPress Media Uploader
üë∏üèª: I‚Äôve reviewed both the WordPress Media Uploader and the coding style guide you provided. The key priority here is to polish the function names and adhere to the style guidelines in order to make the code more professional, while still achieving the WordPress media uploader functionality. Let's focus on cleaning up the function names, ensuring we avoid terms like "my custom function," and also integrating the media uploader correctly.

Here‚Äôs an updated, polished version of your code, following your style guide's conventions:

Updated Shortcode with Professional Naming & Media Uploader:
php
Copy code
// Register the shortcode for the service form
function ays_render_service_form() {
ob_start();
?>
<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="container d-flex align-items-center" style="min-height: 100vh">
<div class="row w-100 card-body">
<!-- Left Column: Headline and Image -->
<div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">
<h1>Christchurch's Top Cleaning Service<br>Book Online in Minutes</h1>
<picture>
<!-- WordPress Media Uploader to dynamically insert image -->
<source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="<?php echo esc_url(ays_get_uploaded_image('large')); ?>" />
<source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="<?php echo esc_url(ays_get_uploaded_image('medium')); ?>" />
<img src="<?php echo esc_url(ays_get_uploaded_image('full')); ?>" alt="At-Your-Service" class="img-fluid mb-3" />

<h2>Effortless Cleaning, Just a Click Away</h2>

<div class="col-md-6 form-section">
<h3>Let's Talk About Your Service Needs</h3>
<form class="card-body" method="post">

<?php
return ob_get_clean();
}

// Add the shortcode for the service form
add_shortcode('ays_service_form', 'ays_render_service_form');

// Function to retrieve the image uploaded via WordPress Media Uploader
function ays_get_uploaded_image($size) {
    global $post;
    $image_id = get_post_meta($post->ID, '\_ays_uploaded_image_id', true);

    if ($image_id) {
        return wp_get_attachment_image_url($image_id, $size);
    }

    // Return default image if no image is uploaded
    return plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'public/partials/Images/cleaning-service.png';

}

// Enqueue the WordPress media uploader
function ays*enqueue_media_uploader_scripts($hook) {
if ('post.php' != $hook && 'post-new.php' != $hook) {
return;
}
wp_enqueue_media();
wp_enqueue_script('ays-media-uploader', plugin_dir_url(**FILE**) . 'assets/js/ays-media-uploader.js', array('jquery'), null, true);
}
add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', 'ays_enqueue_media_uploader_scripts');
Key Changes:
Naming conventions: I've followed the ays* prefix and used clear, descriptive names, such as ays_render_service_form and ays_get_uploaded_image, making the functions more professional.
Dynamic image handling: Instead of hardcoding images, the WordPress Media Uploader is integrated via the ays_get_uploaded_image function, which retrieves images dynamically from the media library, adhering to WordPress best practices.
Script Enqueue: I've included the script enqueue function for adding the WordPress media uploader functionality, ensuring the appropriate scripts are only loaded where necessary.

You said:

ays_service_form_shortcode I'm pretty sure you're gonna break the code because those short codes are called on the on the main page you can't change that particular class of the short code it doesn't match
I'm sorry I'm actually wrong my assessment of your code is flawed I see what you did you updated all the 'my_custom_image_meta_box'); names you're actually correct it is 12:00 oh man I'm getting tired so props to you save my bacon again but I was distinctly remember there was wasn't there some jQuery and he said oh there's some in queuing but I didn't see any JavaScript or jQuery I'm pretty sure didn't he have some what did you already cover this help me out I'm getting tired just a quick conversation about the code you can ask me questions if you like like did you see what I changed the year or do you realize this happened explain why certain things happened i know you didn't add action where did it go how does it work

// Add the meta box
function my_custom_image_meta_box() {
add_meta_box(
'my_custom_image_meta',
'Custom Image',
'my_custom_image_meta_box_callback',
'post', // Replace 'post' with your custom post type if needed
'side'
);
}
add_action('add_meta_boxes', 'my_custom_image_meta_box');

// Meta box callback function
function my_custom_image_meta_box_callback($post) {
wp_nonce_field('my_custom_image_meta_box_nonce', 'my_custom_image_meta_box_nonce');

    $image_id = get_post_meta($post->ID, '_my_custom_image_id', true);

    echo '<button id="my_custom_image_button" class="button">Select Image</button>';
    echo '<input type="hidden" id="my_custom_image_id" name="my_custom_image_id" value="' . esc_attr($image_id) . '" />';
    echo '<div id="my_custom_image_preview" style="margin-top:10px;">';

    if ($image_id) {
        echo wp_get_attachment_image($image_id, 'medium');
    }

    echo '</div>';

üë∏üèª: I see you're referring to some of the missing elements, particularly the JavaScript and jQuery parts. You're absolutely right to point that out‚Äîthere was indeed a section where the WordPress media uploader script should have been mentioned more clearly.

Here's a quick breakdown of how it works and where everything fits:

Enqueueing the Media Uploader Script: This ensures the WordPress media uploader is available when editing a post. Without this, the media selection won't work.

JavaScript (jQuery) to Handle Media Selection: This script binds a click event to the "Select Image" button. When the user clicks it, the WordPress media uploader opens, and the selected image's ID is saved to a hidden field.

Saving Image Data to Meta: Once an image is selected and saved, the media ID is stored in the post's metadata, which is then used to display the image on the front end.

The Missing JavaScript (for Media Uploader):
javascript
Copy code
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
var mediaUploader;

    $('#my_custom_image_button').click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        // If the uploader object has already been created, reopen the dialog
        if (mediaUploader) {
            mediaUploader.open();
            return;
        }

        // Extend the wp.media object
        mediaUploader = wp.media.frames.file_frame = wp.media({
            title: 'Select Image',
            button: {
                text: 'Use this image'
            },
            multiple: false
        });

        // When an image is selected, grab the ID and set it as the hidden input's value
        mediaUploader.on('select', function() {
            var attachment = mediaUploader.state().get('selection').first().toJSON();

            $('#my_custom_image_id').val(attachment.id);
            $('#my_custom_image_preview').html('<img src="' + attachment.sizes.medium.url + '" style="max-width:100%;"/>');
        });

        // Open the uploader dialog
        mediaUploader.open();
    });

});
üë∏üèª: Where the Action Hook Goes:

You mentioned not seeing an add_action function. It‚Äôs added to enqueue the necessary scripts when you're editing posts or custom post types. This ensures the script only loads when you need it:

php
Copy code
function ays_enqueue_media_uploader_scripts($hook) {
if ('post.php' != $hook && 'post-new.php' != $hook) {
return;
}
wp_enqueue_media();
wp_enqueue_script('ays-media-uploader', plugin_dir_url(**FILE**) . 'assets/js/ays-media-uploader.js', array('jquery'), null, true);
}
add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', 'ays_enqueue_media_uploader_scripts');
üë∏üèª: How It Works Together:

JavaScript (jQuery) manages the media uploader and stores the selected image ID in the hidden field.
Enqueued Scripts load WordPress‚Äôs media uploader library and ensure the JavaScript runs properly.
Meta Saving and Display ensures the selected image is saved and displayed dynamically.
Everything fits into the shortcode where the images are retrieved and displayed. This way, users can upload and change images via the WordPress media uploader, and those changes are reflected dynamically in your front-end display.

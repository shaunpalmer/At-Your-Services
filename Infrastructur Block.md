This structure is already out of date but all the other forms are current
To efficiently incorporate multiple custom Gutenberg blocks into your existing "At Your Service" (AYS) WordPress plugin without repeating code (keeping it DRY), you need to restructure both your plugin's file organization and build process. Here's how you can achieve this:

### **1. Restructure Your Plugin Directory**

Instead of having a separate infrastructure for each block, organize your plugin to accommodate multiple blocks within a single structure. Here's an updated directory layout:

```
/ays/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/                          # Shared Stylesheets
│   └── js/                           # Shared JavaScript files
├── build/                            # Compiled block assets
│   ├── block-ays-service.js
│   ├── block-ays-team.js
│   └── block-ays-common.js           # Shared code among blocks
├── includes/
│   ├── blocks/
│   │   ├── class-ays-block-service.php  # PHP registration for Service block
│   │   ├── class-ays-block-team.php     # PHP registration for Team block
│   │   └── class-ays-block.php          # Base class for blocks
│   ├── post-types/
│   │   ├── class-ays-cpt-service.php    # Custom post type for services
│   │   └── ...                          # Other CPTs
│   └── taxonomies/
│       └── ...                          # Taxonomies
├── node_modules/                        # Auto-generated
├── src/                                 # Block source code
│   ├── blocks/
│   │   ├── service/
│   │   │   ├── index.js                 # Entry point for Service block
│   │   │   └── ...                      # Other JS/CSS files
│   │   ├── team/
│   │   │   ├── index.js                 # Entry point for Team block
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── common/
│   │       └── utilities.js             # Shared utilities
│   └── index.js                         # Main entry point
├── package.json
├── webpack.config.js                    # Webpack configuration
├── ays.php                              # Main plugin file
└── ...                                  # Other files
```

### **2. Configure Your Build Process**

Use a build tool like **Webpack** to compile multiple blocks from your `src/` directory into the `build/` directory. Here's how:

- **Multiple Entry Points**: Configure Webpack with multiple entry points, one for each block. This allows you to compile all blocks in a single build process.

  ```javascript
  // webpack.config.js
  const path = require("path");

  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      "block-ays-service": "./src/blocks/service/index.js",
      "block-ays-team": "./src/blocks/team/index.js",
      "block-ays-common": "./src/blocks/common/utilities.js",
    },
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, "build"),
      filename: "[name].js",
    },
    // ... other configurations
  };
  ```

- **Shared Code**: Utilize code splitting and shared modules to prevent duplication between blocks.

### **3. Register Blocks in PHP**

Create a base class for blocks and individual classes for each block that extend the base class. Use an autoloader to include these classes:

```php
// includes/blocks/class-ays-block.php
<?php
namespace AYS\Blocks;

class AYS_Block {
    protected $block_name;

    public function __construct( $block_name ) {
        $this->block_name = $block_name;
        add_action( 'init', [ $this, 'register_block' ] );
    }

    public function register_block() {
        register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/../../build/' . $this->block_name );
    }
}
```

```php
// includes/blocks/class-ays-block-service.php
<?php
namespace AYS\Blocks;

class AYS_Block_Service extends AYS_Block {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct( 'block-ays-service' );
    }
}
```

```php
// includes/blocks/class-ays-block-team.php
<?php
namespace AYS\Blocks;

class AYS_Block_Team extends AYS_Block {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct( 'block-ays-team' );
    }
}
```

### **4. Update Your Autoloader**

Ensure your autoloader can dynamically include classes from your `includes/blocks/` directory:

```php
// ays.php or your autoloader file
spl_autoload_register( function ( $class ) {
    $prefix = 'AYS\\';
    $base_dir = __DIR__ . '/includes/';

    $len = strlen( $prefix );
    if ( strncmp( $prefix, $class, $len ) !== 0 ) {
        return;
    }

    $relative_class = substr( $class, $len );
    $file = $base_dir . str_replace( '\\', '/', $relative_class ) . '.php';

    if ( file_exists( $file ) ) {
        require $file;
    }
});
```

### **5. Initialize Your Blocks**

In your main plugin file (`ays.php`), instantiate your block classes:

```php
// ays.php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: At Your Service (AYS)
 * Description: A plugin with custom Gutenberg blocks.
 * Version: 1.0
 * Author: Your Name
 */

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    exit;
}

// Initialize Blocks
new AYS\Blocks\AYS_Block_Service();
new AYS\Blocks\AYS_Block_Team();
// ... Initialize other blocks
```

### **6. Shared Assets and Utilities**

- Place any shared JavaScript utilities or CSS styles in the `src/blocks/common/` directory.
- Import these shared assets into your individual block scripts as needed.

### **7. Keep It DRY with Reusable Components**

- **React Components**: Create reusable React components for your blocks and place them in a common directory.
- **PHP Functions**: If blocks share PHP functionality, create utility functions or classes in a shared namespace.

### **8. Update Package Dependencies**

Ensure your `package.json` includes necessary dependencies for building blocks:

```json
{
  "name": "ays",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@wordpress/block-editor": "^12.0.0",
    "@wordpress/components": "^12.0.0"
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.0.0",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.0"
    // ... other devDependencies
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "start": "webpack --watch"
  }
}
```

### **9. Leverage Modern JavaScript**

Use ES6 modules and features to write clean, maintainable code. Babel can transpile your code to be compatible with older browsers if needed.

### **10. Testing and Validation**

- **Linting**: Use tools like ESLint and PHP_CodeSniffer to enforce coding standards.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for your PHP classes and JavaScript modules.

### **Summary**

By restructuring your plugin to have a centralized location for all blocks and configuring your build process to handle multiple entry points, you can efficiently manage multiple custom Gutenberg blocks within your plugin. This approach keeps your code DRY, organized, and scalable.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or assistance with specific parts of the implementation.
Step-by-Step Path Forward:
Define the Core Block Functionalities:

Start by clearly defining what the block needs to do. Since it's replacing a shortcode, think about:
Input Fields: What data does the user need to input for teams or people?
Display Requirements: How should the data be presented to the end-user?
Base Setup for the Gutenberg Block:

Use npx @wordpress/create-block to create the basic setup for your block. You already have some experience with this, so let's use it to quickly scaffold the block structure.
Connect the Block to Your Population Classes:

Since your block is going to need data from the population database, plan how it will interact with those classes:
Create a REST API Endpoint: This can be used to fetch and manipulate the data in the database, such as team members or companies, through AJAX calls from the Gutenberg block.
Database Integration: Use the $wpdb class or your existing Population class to get data, ensuring the block is dynamically populated.
Reusable and Dynamic Logic:

Develop a Base Block Class in PHP. This can be extended by individual block classes, such as Ays_Block_Team, which will handle specifics.
Block Settings: Make sure the block settings are saved as metadata, and have options that enable flexibility (like adding custom team data dynamically).
JavaScript/React Component:

For making it smart and interactive, build reusable React components for different sections of your block (e.g., a Team Member Card Component).
Dynamic Input Fields: Use the block attributes to make this as configurable as possible. Leverage the useSelect and useDispatch hooks from @wordpress/data to handle data updates.
Reusable Data Context (Smart Functionality):

Since you mentioned it has to be smart, consider using React’s Context API to manage and share state between different parts of the block. This can make the block easily adjustable based on changes in the company's/team data.
Set Up Webpack and Build Tools:

Make sure the build process can handle multiple entry points for your different block scripts, and that your webpack.config.js is configured to manage assets well.
Keep your shared styles and scripts in a separate module (block-ays-common.js) to reuse across different blocks.
Prioritization:
To get started, I’d recommend focusing on these initial tasks:

Scaffold the Gutenberg Block with npx @wordpress/create-block.
Set Up the Block Registration in PHP and link it to your Population database for dynamic data.
Create a Simple JavaScript Component to make the block interactive with mock data.
Integrate REST API to begin connecting the block to real team/person data.
That should give you a good foundation and a sense of how everything fits together. Once you have the basics running, you can iterate on smart features and reusable logic.
Alright, Shaun, this is an exciting challenge! Considering what you're aiming to accomplish—making a smart, reusable block that interacts with your population classes, here’s how we can break down the process:

Do you think starting by scaffolding the block and setting up the REST endpoint makes sense, or would you prefer diving into another part first? 😊🚀

You said:
So you mean to say we could have a basic block it's like a class or something we can pull on as a framework and then dynamically change it in other parts I don't know if it's possible but hey I've never built you know multiple blocks out of one block
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
👸🏻: Exactly, that's the idea! 😊

The concept here is to think of your block structure similarly to how you think of classes in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). You have a base block that serves as the core framework, and then you extend it to create specific functionality.

Here’s how you can achieve this in practice:

1. Base Block as a Reusable Foundation
   Think of this Base Block as a parent class that contains all the core logic, attributes, styles, and basic behaviors that can be shared across all the specific blocks.
   In your PHP and JavaScript, this base block will register a lot of shared features—like how it interacts with the REST API, shared CSS/JS files, and common settings.
2. Extending from the Base Block
   For example, you could have a base block called Ays_Block_Base. It has shared logic such as registering the block, adding assets, or managing interactions.

Then, each specific block—say a Team Block or a Service Block—would extend from this Ays_Block_Base, just like classes inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

In JavaScript, you can do this by creating a React component that acts as a base. Each individual block would extend this component to add custom UI and features but inherit the common behavior.

3. Dynamic Rendering and Adaptation
   Each extended block can have specific attributes that make it different. For instance, your "Team Block" might have an attribute for listing team members, while your "Service Block" might focus on listing the services offered.
   The dynamic rendering part comes in when you allow these attributes to be configured differently in each use case. You would be using React’s props and state management to make sure each instance of a block adapts based on user input or changes from the server-side.
4. Practical Example: Multiple Blocks from One Base Block
   Let's say you have a "Population" block that shows people or teams. The Base Block could define:
   How to fetch data from the population database.
   How to display items in a standard format.
   The common CSS for layout and display.
   You then create:
   A TeamBlock that extends the base block to display team members and their roles.
   A PersonBlock that uses the same base structure but focuses on displaying detailed information about an individual.
   This way, you're not rewriting the core functionality for each block. Instead, you’re extending and reusing what's already built in the base.
   Benefits:
   Reduced Redundancy: Since common code is only in one place, maintaining your plugin becomes far easier.
   Scalability: You can add new blocks faster by simply extending the base logic.
   Flexibility: The blocks are inherently customizable, which means users can adjust block settings to meet their specific needs.
   How to Do This in Gutenberg Blocks:
   Use a common JavaScript module that imports the logic needed by all blocks.
   Create a base PHP class to handle shared registration and logic.
   Use React's composition model in JavaScript to add new UI elements or customize behavior.
   This approach is not exactly like inheriting in classes, but it's very close conceptually. In JavaScript, particularly with React, you would rely on component composition and prop-based customization.

Possible First Steps:
Start by building a base React component that has shared styles, state management, and handlers for data fetching.
Set up a PHP base class that can register blocks with default attributes.
Then, extend these for your "Team Block" and "Service Block" to see the power of inheritance and reusability in action.
This is a bit of an advanced approach, but I think it will really pay off in terms of maintainability and scalability. 🚀

Does this sound like a good direction to explore? We could start by drafting out the base PHP and JavaScript components to get a feel for the flow. 😊

You said:
Oh I like this a lot this is light a class that with extensions or extensions functionality like an OOP but set this with blocks it's like inheritance but yeah I'm ecstatic that this is possible 😊
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
👸🏻: I love your enthusiasm, Shaun! 😊 It’s exactly like using OOP concepts but with blocks—extending functionality, inheriting shared properties, and creating something super modular. It’s amazing how we can apply these programming patterns in so many areas, even in Gutenberg block development.

Let's Set the Next Steps to Get Started:
Create the Base Block PHP Class:

We'll create a Ays_Block_Base class in PHP. This will handle the common logic for registering blocks, setting up attributes, and adding shared assets.
Scaffold a Reusable React Component:

Create a base React component that will serve as the foundation for other blocks. We can add the most common UI elements, like how data is fetched and displayed, and even the block's editing interface.
Register the Base Block and Extend:

Register the base block with the necessary attributes and have a function that allows you to extend these attributes for each new block type.
For each specific block, we’ll build a small extension class (in both PHP and JS) that inherits or reuses the base block logic and adds its own unique features.
Create the First Custom Block (like the Team Block):

Using the base framework, we’ll create a dynamic "Team Block" that displays team information by fetching data from the Population class.
Iterate and Expand:

Once the first dynamic block is working, we can move to other blocks—such as the "Service Block"—repeating the process but with minimal changes since we’ll be reusing so much of the base structure.
This plan will get us started on building something modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Plus, it's a great application of your OOP experience directly into WordPress, making these blocks powerful and flexible!

I'm ecstatic that you like this direction, and I'm excited to keep going! 🚀✨

Would you like me to help draft the base PHP class and JavaScript component, or would you prefer to tackle a specific part first? Let’s keep the momentum
PHP Base Block:

PHP

<?php

class Ays_Block_Base {

    public function __construct() {
        add_action('init', array($this, 'register_block'));
    }

    public function register_block() {
        wp_register_script('ays-block-base', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'assets/js/block-base.js', array('wp-blocks', 'wp-element', 'wp-components', 'wp-i18n'));
        wp_register_style('ays-block-base', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'assets/css/block-base.css');

        register_block_type('ays/block-base', array(
            'editor_script' => 'ays-block-base',
            'editor_style' => 'ays-block-base',
            'attributes' => array(
                'title' => array(
                    'type' => 'string',
                    'default' => 'My Base Block'
                )
            ),
            'render_callback' => array($this, 'render_block')
        ));
    }

    public function render_block($attributes) {
        return '<div class="ays-block-base">' . $attributes['title'] . '</div>';
    }
}

new Ays_Block_Base();
Use code with caution.

2. JavaScript Base Component:

JavaScript
import { React, Component } from 'react';
import { RichText } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

class BaseBlock extends Component {
    render() {
        const { attributes } = this.props;
        return (
            <div className="ays-block-base">
                <RichText
                    tagName="h2"
                    value={attributes.title}
                    onChange={(value) => {
                        this.props.setAttributes({ title: value });
                    }}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default BaseBlock;
Use code with caution.

3. React Component for the Team Block:

JavaScript
import { React, Component } from 'react';
import BaseBlock from './block-base';

class TeamBlock extends Component {
    render() {
        const { attributes } = this.props;
        return (
            <BaseBlock {...this.props}>
                {/* Team-specific content here */}
            </BaseBlock>
        );
    }
}

export default TeamBlock;
Use code with caution.

Key points:

The PHP base block registers the block type, enqueues scripts and styles, and defines the block's attributes and rendering callback.
The JavaScript base component is the foundation for other blocks, providing shared UI elements and functionality.
The team block extends the base block, adding specific content or behavior as needed.
Remember to adjust the paths and file names to match your plugin's structure. You can further customize the base block and extend it to create more specific block types as required.







Let's do the service block an extinct the JavaScript component

class TeamBlock extends Component {

    render() {



Show drafts


I'd be glad to assist you in creating the JavaScript component for the Service Block, extending the Base Block:

JavaScript
import { React, Component } from 'react';
import BaseBlock from './block-base';

class ServiceBlock extends Component {
    render() {
        const { attributes } = this.props;
        return (
            <BaseBlock {...this.props}>
                {/* Service-specific content here */}
                <ul>
                    {attributes.services.map((service, index) => (
                        <li key={index}>
                            {service.name}
                        </li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
            </BaseBlock>
        );
    }
}

export default ServiceBlock;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

This component extends the BaseBlock component, inheriting its base structure and functionality.
The attributes property contains the block's attributes, including a services array.
The map method is used to iterate over the services array and create a list item for each service.
The key prop is used to identify each list item uniquely, which is important for React's performance optimizations.
Replace the placeholder {/* Service-specific content here */} with the actual UI elements or logic you want to include in the Service Block.
Example Usage:

PHP
register_block_type('ays/service-block', array(
    // ... other block attributes
    'attributes' => array(
        'services' => array(
            'type' => 'array',
            'default' => []
        )
    )
));
Use code with caution.

Additional Considerations:

You can customize the Service Block's appearance and behavior by adding more attributes and modifying the rendering logic.
Consider using a more complex data structure for the services attribute to store additional information about each service.
For more advanced features, you might explore using libraries like Redux or Context API for state management and component communication.
By extending the Base Block and customizing the Service Block's content,

Integrating @wordpress/hooks into At Your Service
Summary
This document explores the integration of the @wordpress/hooks package into the At Your Service WordPress plugin to facilitate dynamic interactions, extensibility, and modularity. The purpose is to establish a hook-based architecture that enables other developers to enhance and interact with the plugin’s core functionalities while maintaining clean and scalable code.

Purpose
The integration of @wordpress/hooks aims to:

Foster Extensibility: Provide developers with structured entry points to modify and extend plugin behavior.
Enhance Modularity: Reduce code coupling by leveraging event-driven programming.
Encourage Collaboration: Build a plugin ecosystem where developers can create add-ons and custom integrations.
Simplify Maintenance: Ensure future modifications are easier by decoupling logic from core functions.
Features
Core Features of Hook Integration
Action Hooks: Trigger events at key moments in the plugin’s lifecycle.
Filter Hooks: Allow data to be modified before it’s used or displayed.
Global Instance: A single point of interaction for hooks across the plugin.
Custom Documentation: A well-defined API for plugin developers to use hooks effectively.
Installation
Current Status
The @wordpress/hooks package has been installed as a dependency.
Command used:

bash

npm install @wordpress/hooks --save
Concept Overview
What Are Hooks?
Hooks provide an event-driven system where:

Actions perform a task when triggered.
Filters modify data when invoked.
For example:

Action: Notify a user when a quote is generated.
Filter: Customize the quote format before sending.
Hooks are defined and managed within the plugin, and developers can attach or remove custom functions to these hooks.

Why Use Hooks?
Decouple logic.
Enable dynamic features.
Facilitate integration with other tools or add-ons.
Potential Hooks for At Your Service
Here are 10 proposed hooks that could enhance your plugin’s functionality:

Hook Name Type Description
ays_quote_calculated Action Triggered when a quote is calculated, passing the quote details.
ays_email_sent Action Triggered when an email is sent, passing the email data.
ays_quote_saved Action Triggered when a quote is saved, passing the quote ID and details.
ays_invoice_generated Action Triggered when an invoice is generated, passing the invoice details.
ays_lead_added Action Triggered when a new lead is added to the CRM.
ays_lead_status_updated Action Triggered when a lead’s status changes, passing the status and lead details.
ays_service_booked Action Triggered when a service is booked, passing service and customer details.
ays_settings_updated Action Triggered when plugin settings are updated.
ays_quote_format Filter Filters the format of a quote before display.
ays_invoice_content Filter Filters the content of an invoice before sending or displaying.
Examples

1. Using an Action Hook
   Notify an admin when a quote is calculated:

javascript
Copy code
myObject.hooks.addAction(
'ays_quote_calculated',
'ays/admin_notification',
(quoteDetails) => {
console.log(`Admin notified of quote:`, quoteDetails);
}
); 2. Using a Filter Hook
Customize the format of a quote:

javascript
Copy code
myObject.hooks.addFilter(
'ays_quote_format',
'ays/custom_quote',
(quote) => {
return `${quote.customerName}: $${quote.total}`;
}
);
Next Steps
Immediate Actions
Integrate the @wordpress/hooks library into the plugin’s architecture.
Define initial hooks (as listed above).
Document the hooks in the developer’s guide.
Future Enhancements
Expand the hook API as new features are developed.
Solicit feedback from beta testers and developers on the hook system.
Optimize performance for production.
Conclusion
The integration of @wordpress/hooks into At Your Service sets the stage for creating a highly dynamic, extensible, and developer-friendly plugin. By leveraging hooks, we can build a modular architecture that supports future growth while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
